<p>Personal profile</p>
<p>A programming proficient industry experienced third-year Computer Science undergraduate seeking a graduate role in the software development sector. Completed a placement internship year at Oracle as an Agile Solution 
Engineer, developing low code applications utilising the SCRUM (Agile) methodology in customer workshops and development as well as being officially trained as a Scrum Master. Extensive client-focused work experience with 
highly developed communication, teamwork and leadership skills. Skilled in various programming languages including Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, CSS, PHP, Scala and HTML; with a passion to further develop these skills in 
personal time and within a work environment.</p>

<p>Skills and abilities:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Problem solving</dt>
	<dd>Throughout my years of work experience and my placement year my problem-solving abilities have been challenged and improved via many new hurdles and tasks. In one case a large task was set to myself and 
my team whilst at work for British Food Store Online, my solution to ensure as much work was done in the allotted timeframe at a high standard was to employ a method which I would later be taught at university is 
a key system for agile work environments, SCRUM. I evaluated the problem and broke it down into its core problems or tasks and kept track of these on our office whiteboard. This allowed our small team to 
finish a large task incrementally as well as keep track and review said work.</dd>

	<dt>Communication and teamwork </dt>
	<dd>These skills are vital for an effective workplace, having worked with many colleagues at multiple establishments I have learned to adapt and integrate everyone’s skills to get tasks done. An example of these 
skills being tested and developed was during my time at Oracle in which I worked with people from different time zones on numerous complex solutions.</dd>

	<dt>Leadership</dt>
	<dd>Towards the end of my time at British Food Store Online, having worked at the IT assistant role, knowing I was moving on to university I was entrusted with training new young assistants on the job role and 
what is expected, which further developed my leadership skills. After showing leadership through the self-organising development teams that I was a part of during the projects in my placement year at Oracle, 
I was able to undertake official training via Scrum.org to be Scrum Master trained. I then used this when I scrum mastered a high-value customer project, the key role of which is organising customer workshops and 
enabling those in my teams to work effectively by providing paths to solutions and removing obstacles.</dd>

	<dt>Programming</dt>
	<dd>I have been programming in multiple languages and environments over the years and these are the languages I have a competent understanding of Java, Python, PHP, Scala, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and SQL. I have 
had to adapt my understanding of multiple languages throughout my education from high school to university at De Montfort. My SQL, JavaScript, CSS and HTML skills were further developed during my Oracle 
internship as these were the primary languages used in our solution and app development for customers.</dd>

			<li>Agile (“Scrum”) workshops and development - The Speciality Agile team was dedicated within Oracle to explore new customer solutions using the Scrum framework, a high value and iterative framework, 
to produce apps for customers at a fast and efficient pace whilst producing high value and high-quality results.</li>
			<li>Scrum Master - During my time as a developer I explored the avenue of becoming a Scrum Master, I am now officially trained as a Scrum Master by Scrum.org. This is an example of my leadership and teamwork 
capabilities. As a Scrum Master, my role is to clear a path for my team to produce high-value results by removing obstacles and enabling high levels of communication, clarity and transparency.</li>
			<li>Presenting and demoing products - Presenting and demoing products, services and procedures was a regular task during my time at Oracle both internally and for customers. Regularly I would individually

<p>Additional info, hobbies and Interests:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sports - I have loved football since I was very young, this became a huge part of my life from day one. I routinely try to go to as many Aston Villa home games as I can. I also love basketball both watching and 
playing in my spare time. My brother introduced me to it at a young age, I soon began playing seriously, taking time to practice daily to improve my capabilities. This became something I would enjoy with many teammates through 
clubs and competitions throughout the years.</li>
	<li>Programming - I have had a big part of my life dedicated to my passion for software and new technology. In my spare time alongside university I have been developing a basketball statistic aggregator and analysis system 
to compare up to 25 years of recorded basketball player efficiency data to have an answer to basketball's biggest questions; “what is the best team of all time?”. This has always been a huge debate between basketball fans, and I 
thought of my way to conclude an answer as well as develop my skills.</li>
	<li>Courses - Scrum Master (PSM I) trained via Scrum.org</li>
	<li>Licenses - I hold a full clean UK driving license.</li>
